Oh, in the meadow a red kalyna has bent down low,
For some reason, our glorious Ukraine is in sorrow.
And we'll take that red kalyna and we will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And we'll take that red kalyna and we will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!


Do not bend low, oh red kalyna, you have a white flower,
Do not worry, glorious Ukraine, you have a free people.
And we'll take that red kalyna and will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And we'll take that red kalyna and will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
